# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains Python code for building a Movie Recommendation System. The recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System employs collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations. It analyzes user interactions with movies and identifies patterns to predict user preferences accurately.

## Dataset
The system utilizes a movie dataset containing information such as movie ratings, user reviews, genres, and release years. The dataset is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nltkdata/movie-review].

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleanse and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset and understand user preferences and movie characteristics.

3. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Implement collaborative filtering algorithms, such as user-based or item-based filtering, to generate recommendations.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, and mean absolute error.
